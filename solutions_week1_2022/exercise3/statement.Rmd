Suppose that if $\theta = 1$, then $y$ has a Binomial distribution with success probability  $0.2$, and if $\theta = 2$, then $y$ has a Binomial distribution with success probability  $0.6$. Also, suppose that the sample size is $n=10$ and $Pr( \theta = 1) = 0.5$ and $Pr(\theta = 2) = 0.5$. 

a) Write the formula for the marginal probability density for $y$ and sketch it. 
b) What is $Pr( \theta = 1 | y = 3)$
c) skecth the posterior predictive distribution for a new observation $\tilde{y}$ with sample size $\tilde{n}=10$. What is the posterior predictive probability that $\tilde{y}=3$?
