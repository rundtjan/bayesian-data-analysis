This exercise, with many alternative stories and numerical values, is a classical 
example of the importance of prior information and of taking into account the 
baseline prevalence. 

Erik knows that 65\% of his emails are spam. Spam filter classifies 75\% of spam to be spam. Furthermore, filter classifies 6\% of emails as spam even if they are not spam. What is the probability that an email classified as spam is not spam?
